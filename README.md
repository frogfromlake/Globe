**Orbitalone** is a real-time 3D Earth visualization app powered by **TypeScript**, **Three.js**, and custom **GLSL shaders**. It blends beauty and function to deliver intuitive, extensible Earth-based data visualizations ‚Äî including country borders, ocean overlays, news integration, and more. The project is under active development. Beware of bugs and incomplete features! PR's or Issues welcome.

> üõ∞Ô∏è **Orbit Alone**  
> We live on a rock, floating through a silent universe that offers no inherent meaning, no guarantees, and no rescue.  
> Borders, ideologies, histories ‚Äî from space, they vanish. What‚Äôs left is one fragile system, alive by chance and sustained by collaboration.

> üåç **Orbital One**  
> To orbit alone is to realize we are all in the same orbit.  
> One species. One biosphere. One chance to make something of it.  
> If nothing has meaning by default, then everything we choose to care for becomes meaningful ‚Äî together.

**Orbitalone** is a tool for global awareness.  
It visualizes the planet‚Äôs political and environmental complexity,  
not to emphasize division, but to clarify the stakes:  
Only by seeing the whole can we navigate the parts.  
Only by embracing our smallness can we act with purpose.

## üõ† Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frogfromlake/Orbitalone.git
cd Orbitalone/frontend
pnpm install      # or npm install
pnpm dev          # start dev server (http://localhost:5173/)
```

### üÆæ Backend (Go) Setup

The backend serves country-specific news via RSS. It lives in `/backend` and must be started separately.

```bash
cd Orbitalone/backend

# Install Go dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run locally
go run main.go

# Or build binary
go build -o orbitalone-news .
./orbitalone-news
```

## üß™ Config-Driven Design

All app behavior is configurable via `src/configs/config.ts`.

```ts
export const CONFIG = {
  globe: { radius: 1, widthSegments: 128, heightSegments: 64 },
  camera: { initialPosition: { z: 3 }, ... },
  fade: { highlight: 3.5, selection: 2.5 },
  textures: {
    day: "/textures/earth_day_8k.jpg",
    night: "/textures/earth_night_8k.jpg",
    idMap: "/textures/country_id_map_8k_rgb.png"
  },
  ...
};
```

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Under the Hood

- Uses **NASA Blue Marble** (day) and **Black Marble** (night) textures (8K)
- Pixel-perfect hover detection using **RGB-encoded country ID maps**
- Accurate floating labels via **geographic centroids**
- Custom shaders control **lighting**, **glow**, **night lights**, and **interactive outlines**

---

## üåç News Backend

The backend is written in **Go** and serves country-specific news via RSS.  
It's a separate service in `/backend`:

> `GET /api/news?country=DE` ‚Üí returns JSON articles for Germany

See [Installation](#-installation) above for setup.

---

## üì¶ Build

```bash
pnpm build      # builds production-ready app into /dist
```

Assets and textures live in `/public/textures`.

Frontend is deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and the backend is deployed using [Fly.io](https://fly.io).
